      <h1>Chapter 5 Hands-On Practice Case</h1>
      
      <div id="content">
         <h2>1.</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>The JavaJam website uses a hierarchical design.</li> 
            <li>For the content delivered by the JavaJam site, the hierarchical design is the most appropriate.</li> 
            <li>There's no reason for the site's content pages to follow a linear layout as the information on those 
                pages are not reliant on having seen a previous page's information.</li> 
            <li>A random layout would make finding the information a visitor is interested in needlessly difficult to find.</li> 
         </ul>
         
         <h2>2.</h2>
         <ul>
            <li><h4>Design practices the site does well:</h4></li>
            <ol>
               <li>The site uses an appropriate color scheme, including good text to background contrast.</li>
               <li>Consistent layout and design of each page on the site, including navigation and content areas.</li>
               <li>Information on the site is easy to find and clearly organized.</li>
            </ol>
            <li><h4>Design practices that could be improved:</h4></li>
            <ol>
               <li>By following the JavaJam case studies, not all the navigation hyperlinks work. The job page does not exist.
                   (I created a temporary page for the Jobs link for my own sanity.)</li>
               <li>No navigational aids are used on the page. There are no links in the footer for accessiblity nor a skip to content link.</li>
               <li>There is no measure of timeliness on the page. The music page has acts for January and Febuary, but no year, and those months
                   have come and gone.</li>
            </ol>
            <li><h4>Other possible improvements:</h4></li>
            <ol>
               <li>The navigation links are somewhat bland and could also be moved to the left of the screen.</li>
               <li>Either the Jobs page should be created or the link removed until it is ready, so the user doesn't get a "Page not found" error.</li>
               <li>The menu could using something more interesting than just text descriptions of products.</li> 
            </ol>           
         </ul>
