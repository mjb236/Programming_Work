	To avoiding getting the "BOOM!!!" message while running ./what, the fourth number 
you enter must be the sum of the first three numbers you enter. The program will read in 
all of the numbers. Then it will sum the first two numbers you entered, take that sum and 
add the third number you enter. Then, it compares that final sum to the fourth number you enter.

If the sum of the first three numbers equals the fourth number, the message "Congrat!!!" is
display. If the two are unequal, the message "BOOM!!!" is displayed.

Details on the storage and process:

First number is stored in address 0x10 + $esp
Second number is stored in address 0x14 + $esp
Third number is stored in address 0x18 + $esp
Fourth number is stored in addres 0x1c + $esp

The number at 0x10 + $esp(first) is moved into %edx.
The number at 0x14 + $esp(second) is moved into %eax
%eax is added to %edx, result stored in %edx. (first and second entries summed)
The number at 0x18 + $esp(third) is moved into %eax.
%eax is added to %edx, result stored in %edx. (third entry added to previous sum)
The number at 0x1c + $esp(fourth) is moved into %eax.
The number in %eax is compared to the number in %edx.
If the numbers are equal, print "Congrat!!!".
If the numbers are not equal, print "Boom!!!".
