These reviews are meant to serve as more of a sprint summary and provide documentation regarding where we stand as 
of the end of sprint 3.  They detail some of the pros and cons of the code, and provide us with some guidelines/reminders
of things we intend to do before moving forward.

Also, much of our code is still in developement, which is why some of them are missing testers.  

For The GUI, we will draw up test documaentation in place of a java tester.  This is standard practise on 
client side GUI testing, which must be performed by a user.

It should be noted the actual results displayed in the GUI will still be tested in a tester.

Update: Sprint 4 Reviws
