Source Code: CardValue

Lines: all

As discussed earlier, the way we were storing card values did not seem natural so a translator was decided on.  
This should make working with our deck and cards easier.

Lines: 1-96

Unofrtunately it would seem the initializing in the way chosen seems necessary.  Because this project is for poker,
we do not have to think about add jokers or other cards.  Good null value handling.

Lines: 96-110

Good. Returns integer card value.  More of a developer side function.

Lines: Rest

toString methods meant to print a user friendly way. Accepts a card object and String.

I personally keep toString/print methods near the end of my code for a little clarity. 
I have found putting them at the end, since toString methods are usually smaller, makes them easier to find.

In addition, it might be easier to read code of methods are sorted by return types unless there is another logical flow.

Code well commented.

From a developer side, because of the switch cases, some better organization maybe be neccessary.
