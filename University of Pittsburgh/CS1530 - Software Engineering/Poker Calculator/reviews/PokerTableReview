Source Code: PokerTable

Seems unclear whether or not this is our highest level as far as the game is concerned.

This is the poker table, but it does not handle the hole cards. This code should probably be renamed to something closer to flop object
perhaps or something reflecting it does not represent the table, but rather the flop.

This code must be refactored.

As a flop object, the code seems to work.
